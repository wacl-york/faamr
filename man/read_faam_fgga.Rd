\usage{
read_faam_fgga(
  filepath,
  allowExtrapolatedCal = TRUE,
  requireHighFlow = FALSE,
  averageNanoString = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{filepath}{path to file}

\item{allowExtrapolatedCal}{mole fraction error flags can take the values 0, 1 and 2.
\itemize{
   \item 0 signifies valid data and is always retained. 
   \item 1 signifies reduced accuracy data where the calibration has been extrapolated
   \item 2 signifies missing data, and these are always removed
   }
Setting this value to FALSE removed data where the flag is 1. Default TRUE}

\item{requireHighFlow}{The FGGA is capable of 10 Hz measurements, but is required to be in High Flow mode. 
This is flagged by the instrument_flow column, where flag == 1 is high flow mode, suitable for 10 Hz data
when \code{requireHighFlow == TRUE}, all the data is filtered for flag == 1, otherwise, flag %in% c(0, 1) is allowed
default FALSE}

\item{averageNanoString}{string to pass to \code{nanotime::nano_floor(date, nanotime::as.nanoduration(averageNanoString))} for resampling date
For example to resample to 10 Hz, argument is "00:00:00.1", for 1 hz it is "00:00:00"}
